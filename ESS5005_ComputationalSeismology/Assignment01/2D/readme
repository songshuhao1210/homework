This is a 2D FDM Acoustic wave simulation.

functions:
change velocity models(homogeneous, layer, heterogeneous)
change sources
change boundaries(free,absorbing)

simulation record:

homogeneous: speed = 5; t_end = 12; fmin,fmax = -0.05,0.05
layer : speed = 10; t_end = 8; fmin,fmax = -0.05,0.05
heterogeneous: speed =  10; t_end = 4; f_min,f_max = -0.01,0.01

official:(layer model, 2 sources)
dx = 5, speed = 50
